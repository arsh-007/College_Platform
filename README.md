# College_Platform 


## Motivation

As in this online education system students have to check different platforms like MS Teams, classroom and sometimes WhatsApp regularly to stay aware of the important notices and exams, so it will comfortable to find all these stuff at oneplace.

It was felt that sending the link a minute prior on different platforms causesnervousness to students as well as can also disrupt the teachers schedule.

A poll system was also added to have transparency and feedback betweenstudents and teachers

This reduces the steps from TEACHER -> CR -> STUDENT -> CR -> TEACHER To TEACHER -> STUDENT -> TEACHER

There was also a need for a chat platform integrated with our website so it was added

## Features

It has a chat lounge and rooms for different chats that can be accessed after logging in

It has a polls app that allows teachers to create polls and set an expiration and activation date after the expiration date and time poll results are visible

It has a quiz app that allows teachers to create links for quizzes and set an expiration and activation date and the links are shown only post activation date and time

It has a announcement app that allows teachers to post announcements

The creation of polls, quizzes and announcements can be showed to whomever the teacher wishes to show (i.e. branch and year)

The admin has the power to verify the student account and give it teacher priviliges

## Validation of Errors

For creation of quizzes there is a feature in place to check that the quizzes don't collide and the starting time and ending timings are valid similarily for the polls app

The polls app has a feture allowing only one vote to be cast by each student after authentication

Students can only use a unique email id with the institute domain to access the website

Only verified teachers' accounts are allowed to access Dashboard
