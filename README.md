# College_Platform 

## Motivation

As in this online education system students have to check different platforms like MS Teams, classroom and sometimes WhatsApp regularly to stay aware of the important notices and exams, so it will comfortable to find all these stuff at oneplace.
It was felt that sending the link a minute prior on different platforms causesnervousness to students as well as can also disrupt the teachers schedule.
A poll system was also added to have transparency and feedback betweenstudents and teachers
This reduces the steps from TEACHER -> CR -> STUDENT -> CR -> TEACHER To TEACHER -> STUDENT -> TEACHER
There was also a need for a chat platform integrated with our website so it was added
